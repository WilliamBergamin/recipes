# Pesto

---

## Ingredients  

- 2 cups of basil leaves, or a whole plant 
- 2 garlic cloves
- Juice of 1 lime
- A handful of pine nuts
- 1 tbsp of parmesan
- At least 5 tbsp of olive oil 

## Steps

1. In a blender, mix all of the ingredients. Preferably use high-quality olive oil and fresh parmiggiano reggiano for a better result. Mix until smooth; add a little bit of pasta water if needed; 
2. Enjoy with pasta, on a grilled cheese, a sandwich, pizza or simply with fresh baguette. PS: It pairs amazingly with our homemade gnocchi.
