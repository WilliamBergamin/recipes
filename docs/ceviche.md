# Ceviche

---

## Ingredients  

*2 pers.*

- 450 g sea bass or tilapia
- 1 1/3 cups of lime juce (about 9 or 10 limes)
- 2 tbsp of olive oil
- Zest of 2 limes
- 15 g of cilantro minced, keep 5 leaves for garnish
- 1 tsp of salt
- 1 1/2 thai chili peppers, minced
- 2 cherry tomatoes diced

## Steps

1. Start by juicing all the limes in a measuring cup, and set aside in a big bowl;
2. Cut the fish in small cubes (approximately 1 cm^2 cube) and mix in the big bowl with the lime juice;
3. Mix all other ingredients in the bowl;
4. Set aside in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour or until the fish is cooked. Tip: the fish looks cooked when white inside and out. It should look similar to when it is cooked over heat. If unsure, cut open a cube and look inside to see if the whole piece is enough cooked.
5. Serve with fresh coriander and fresh baguette or crackers.
