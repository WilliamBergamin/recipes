# Fish Tacos

---

## Ingredients

*2 pers.*

- 350 g of tilapia, cod or any white-fleshed fish of your choice;
- 500 ml of craft beer, either blonde or red;
- 2 tbsp of salted butter
- 2 french onions;
- 15 cherry tomatoes;
- 1 mango;
- 100 mg of fresh cilantro
- 2-3 tbsp of olive oil
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- 6 or 7 small corn-flour tortillas

## Steps

1. Mince the french onions, mango, cilantro (keep some for garnish), cherry tomatoes and place in a bowl. Add some olive oil, salt and pepper and set aside.
2. In a medium heated pan, pour the beer and let it boil for 2-3 minutes, then add the salted butter. Lower the heat and mix with a wooden spoon; then add the fish and cover the pan with a lid. Cook the fish in the batter for 10-15 minutes (until soft);
3. Remove the fish and deglaze the pan;
4. Set aside the sauce you just made and on medium heat, sear the fish on both sides;
5. Meanwhile, wrap all the tortillas in foil and put in the oven for 10 minutes. When hot, remove from the oven;
6. Time to make the tacos: in a tortilla, put some fish, add some sauce and homemade salsa. Then, garnish with a few leaves of cilantro. If you want to make it *extra*, it is great with sour cream as well.
