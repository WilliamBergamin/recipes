# Roasted gnocchi

---

## Ingredients  

*2 pers.*

- 2 cups of mashed potatoes - any kind of potato will do, but I prefer yellow or white;
- 4 cups of white-bleached flour;
- Salt and pepper, to taste;
- 1 tbsp of olive oil

## Steps

1. First, peel the potatoes. Then, bring water to a boil and add some salt to it. Drop in the potatoes and cook until soft;
2. Mash the potatoes and let them rest for a little bit for them to cool down;
3. Mix the mashed potatoes with the flour in a big bowl, then let it rest for an hour;
4. From the dough ball that you just made, separate some pieces and make them into long strings;
5. Then, cut the strings in small cubes and smoosh them with a fork for them to look like a gnocchi.
6. When all the dough is transformed into gnocchi, bring water to a boil again, add some salt and drop in the gnocchi. Note: If you feel you have to much gnocchi for your meal, you can easily freeze them by putting parchement paper between them.
7. Cook until all the gnocchi come to the surface; that will mean they are ready.
8. Lastly, in a pan, put some olive oil and roast the freshly cooked gnocchi. This way, they will be crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside. We recommend to enjoy with our homemade pesto.
