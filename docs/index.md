# Welcome

This has started as a simple project to remember some recipes we like to make but somewhat forget exactly what ingredients we used... the website finally turned into a true cooking-bible and ode to our creativity.

It is our comfort food, but also some recipes we like making when having people over or when we feel *fancy*.

## Purpose

This project is intended for personal use but anyone is welcome to check it out and try some recipes. Welcome in our world!
